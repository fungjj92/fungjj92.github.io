Hi there! I'm Jenny. I like to build web software and express myself through creative writing and improv dancing. I spend a lot of time thinking about communication of all sorts: between people, brain/body, animals, and technology. Here, I collect some visual traces of what I do, or think about that I'd like to share. I call the gritty and inimitable Philadelphia (PA, USA) home but carry with me poetic heartache for all the other places I've lived too. I go gaga for queer and experimental live performances, and hope to attend cabarets and Fringe Festivals everywhere.

My most recent software work has been on public sites powered by closed source code. I am pretty inactive on social media with the comical exception that I kind of like to check [LinkedIn][linkedin]. Reach out there or via email if you'd like to chat about shared interests.
