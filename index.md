Hi! I'm Jenny. I like to build web software "for good" and express myself through creative writing and improv dancing. I spend a lot of time thinking about communication of all sorts: between people, brain/body, animals, and technology. Here, I collect some visual traces of what I do, or think about that I'd like to share. I call the spirited and inimitable Philadelphia (PA, USA) home, and will wax poetic about it and all the wonderful places I've lived. I go gaga for queer and experimental live performances, and hope to attend cabarets and Fringe Festivals everywhere.

My most recent software work has been on public sites powered by closed source code. I am pretty inactive on social media with the comical exception that I kind of like to check [LinkedIn][linkedin]. DM me there if you'd like to collaborate on a civic tech project, dance performance, or aimlessly chat otherwise.
